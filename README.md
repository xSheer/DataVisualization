# Data visualization of earthquakes from U.S. Geological Survey & GeoJson.

## Overview
This project visualizes earthquakes and urban cities around the globe. To achieve this different 
virtualization methods are used.

1. Earthquakes got visualized as points with different sizes depending on their maginute. (Zoom level 7+)
2. Heatmap for regions with high levels of earthquakes got colored via *Brewer Palette* (Zoom level 0+)
3. Position of *ISS* live (refreshed every secound) via rocket-symbol

Option
1. Button urban
2. Button earthquakes (vielleicht magniatude ausw√§hlbar)
3. Button toFly ISS
